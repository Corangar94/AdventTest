INTERACTIVE SHAPE DEMO - SETUP GUIDE
============================

Follow these steps to get the interactive shape demo working in your scene:

1. OPEN THE SAMPLE SCENE:
   - Navigate to Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity and open it

2. ADD THE SCENE INITIALIZER:
   - Create an empty GameObject in the scene (Right-click in Hierarchy > Create Empty)
   - Rename it to "SceneInitializer"
   - Add the SceneInitializer component (Add Component > Scripts > SceneInitializer)

3. THAT'S IT!
   - Press Play and the demo will initialize automatically
   - All components will be created at runtime
   - The shape will appear in the center of the screen
   - A menu system will appear at the bottom

============================
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
============================

If you want to customize the demo, you can manually add the core components:

1. MANUALLY ADD GAMEMANAGER:
   - Create an empty GameObject and name it "GameManager"
   - Add the GameManager component to it
   - Now you can assign references in the inspector:
     * ShapeManager
     * MenuController
     * InputController
     * AudioManager
     * InstructionsPanel

2. CUSTOMIZE SHAPES:
   - Create prefabs for your shapes and assign them to the ShapeManager
   - Adjust the size/radius parameters in the shape components

3. CUSTOMIZE UI:
   - Modify the MenuController and InstructionsPanel components
   - Change button colors, text, and layout

============================
TROUBLESHOOTING
============================

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that TextMeshPro is imported (Window > Package Manager > TextMeshPro)
2. Make sure the scene has a camera with the "MainCamera" tag
3. If the shape is not visible, check the camera's position and zoom level
4. Ensure your platform is supported by the Unity input system
